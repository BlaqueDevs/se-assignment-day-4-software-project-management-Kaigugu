## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
* Timely delivery in software projects management builds trust and satisfaction from stakeholders, ensures deadlines are met through clear guidelines and priority setting, proper resource allocation and utilization is done, reduces the risk of going above budgets, upcoming risks are timely noted and mitigated.
* Ways to ensure deadlines are met:-
1) Create the project schedule.
2) Set goals with realistic timelines.
3) Use relevant tools and equipments to manage and track projects.
4) Set priorities and clear guidelines for all parties.
5) Ensure all project members understand their role in the project and communication among them is clear at all stages.
6) Prioritize critical path tasks and clarify on dependency in the project.
7) Identify and put measures to manage risks at all stages.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
* Effective cost control help identify potential cost overruns in an early stage, minimizes unnecessary expenses and works on maximizing efficiency in resource utilization.
* Strategies to prevent budget overruns:-
1) Do a thorough research to plan and allocate resources for the project
2) Encourage collaboration from both internal and external stakeholders
3)  Have a clear project scope and requirements
4)  Use effective tools to track, monitor and control cost and expenses
5)  Ensure all potential risks are well documented include their likelihood, impact on the project budget and activities to be carryout to mitigate the risk.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
*Agile methodology is flepxible and iterative by encouraging continous involvement and feedback from stakeholders whereas Waterfall is rigid and sequential following a step by step order till completion of the project.
* Agile Advantage:-
Encourages collaboration among cross-functional teams, focuses on delivering small and adapts to changes throughout the development process.
Disadvantage:-
It is had to predict the project timiline and budgets as requirements keep changing, Too much stakeholder involvement may expand the project which may not be feasible. 
* Waterfall Advantage:-
The has clear roadmap for execution of the project, with predefined objects that makes setting of deadlines and resource allocation easier.
Disadvantage:-
Its rigidity makes it challenging to accommodate changes at the laoter stages of deivelopment thus deloays maybe experienced during changes or rework issue arises. Lastly due to limited feedback the risk of delivering a project that doesn't meet stakeholder expectations are high.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
* Agile is ideal for dynamic projects that is prone to changes ie innovative products, startups.
Waterfall is ideal for projects with =strict deadlines and budgets ie government contracts, industries with regulatory compliance needs.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
* Quality Assuarance methods:-
1) Designing test cases
2) Performing code reviews
3) Conducting usability tests
4) Monitoring performance and feedback collection.
* IMPORTANCE OF Maintaining high standards is that all stakeholders know what is expected of them throughout the project and this helps build trust with clients.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
* Defining the project scope gives an overview of the entire lifecycle of the project, helps stick to deadlines, stay on track and ensures all stakeholders are well informed.
* WBS is a step by step approach tool used to complete large projects in project management. It contains deliverables, activities and scheduling of each component.  It is useful as it makes projects less overwhelming as it breaks them into bites, has a clear guide for different individuals working on the same project, allocates budget resources and measures project completion.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
* Project schedules aims at minimizing project duration, maintaining stakeholder commitments and maximizing on resources efficiently. It also ensures timely completion of projects, reduces the risk of going over budget thus helping in decision making and eliminating uncertainties. When well executed it helps identify critical paths, dependencies and potential bottlenecks.
* Gantt chart showcases activities and tracks progress of a project, it helps identify resources required, assigned tasks and to whom. Gantt chart can also help identify tasks overlapping, tasks dependent on others and upcoming events.
  
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Core issues:- Manual delivery plan for an electronic supplying company with 13 outlets. The process has loopholes in paperwork loss, lack of track on what was delivered and what was not during the weekend when shifts are changed, when there is collections from branches easily to miss on delivering an item.
Significance of the above problem is the company's experience and image is being destroyed due to poor aftersales service with no accountability tracking tools.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
* You gain a deeper understanding of its nature and scope thus addressing the root cause ensuring a more sustainable solution is executed.
  
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details? 
* By defining a clear and concise summary of the problem your solution is aimed at solving including the benefit s of your solution. Ensure the brief is engaging and persuasive.
  
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Scalability it should accommodate growth
Performance should have good speed and efficiency to ensure responsive user experience
Security regulations ahould be followed to ensure data protection policy is adhered to.
The design should be an intuitive user interface to enhance user experience. 

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
* The global software market size was estimated at USD 295.20 Billion in 2024 Expected growth USD704.10Billion in 2024
Annual growth rate CAGR 2024-2029 OF 5.01% resulting to USD 898.90 Billion by 2029

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
* Gather intel of competitors offers
* Help determine when to test and launch products in the market.
* Identify future opportunities and risks
* Understand customer change in preferences to tailor products
* It also influences your marketing activities
